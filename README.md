# 👋 Hi, I'm Johny Metellus
### On a Journey to CISO‑dom

I'm building a security lab that reflects the kind of leader I aim to become — one who values clarity, visibility, automation, and calm decision‑making.

This GitHub is where I document the architectures, detections, workflows, and governance models that are shaping my growth from practitioner to future CISO.

---

## 🔥 CISO Vision  
Build security programs that empower people, simplify complexity, and make risk visible — leading with clarity, empathy, and purpose.

---

## 🛠️ What I'm Building  
- A full SOC pipeline (Elastic + SecurityOnion)  
- Automated triage enrichment (DNS, TLS, Sysmon, Suricata)  
- Endpoint visibility & hardening (Sysmon, Windows logging, HPDM)  
- Network boundaries & segmentation  
- Real monitoring plans for internal teams & vendors  
- Documentation habits aligned with modern CISO expectations  

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters  
Everything here pushes me closer to the CISO I want to be — strategic, structured, data‑driven, and grounded in real‑world security engineering.

### ⭐ Thanks for stopping by.
