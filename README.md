## The Journey

I'm building my path to becoming a **CISO** the hard way—by actually doing the work.

No shortcuts. No just-enough-to-pass-the-cert studying. I built a real SOC environment in my home lab where I can break things, fix them, and understand how enterprise security actually works.

What started as a basic SecurityOnion setup has grown into a **full enterprise-grade detection and monitoring platform**. I'm not just following tutorials—I'm solving real problems, writing custom detection rules, and building the kind of visibility that organizations need and implement.

Every system I configure, every alert I tune, every incident playbook I write is building the technical foundation and strategic mindset I need to lead security programs.

This repository is my proof of work.

## What I've Built

**🔍 A Production-Grade SOC**  
SecurityOnion + Elastic Stack monitoring real network traffic, with custom dashboards that answer strategic questions, not just technical ones.

**🎯 Detection Engineering**  
Custom Suricata rules, Sysmon configurations, and correlation logic that catches threats hiding in the noise.

**🏗️ Defense Architecture**  
Segmented networks, hardened endpoints, and layered controls—because defense-in-depth isn't just theory.

**📚 Documentation That Teaches**  
Every configuration, every lesson learned, every mistake made and fixed—written so others can follow the same path.
